Here is the content that will explain what this tool is, why it is used and probably links on how to configure it. 
There is going to be no content here, it will actually be a different page when the javascript that does most of the heavy lifting 
renders knowledge articles. 
<br />
Maybe some lovely stuff about Q-Branch in here as well.
